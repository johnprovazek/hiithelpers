# hiithelpers

## Description

This project is a simple Python tkinter application for use at home doing high intensity interval training exercises.

Developed with Python utilizing the tkinter package.

## Installation

This application was developed using Python version 3.11. From the root directory run the following command to launch the application:

```
python ./hiithelpers.py
```

## Credits

Sounds from [KidPix 2](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/42lbwv1qfyp7ox2/AABtBgnW36HJba6T8R70SvJXa?dl=0) were used in this application.

## Bugs & Improvements

- Current images in the application are placeholders. Need to film and create frames for the trainers with [EbSynth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq_KOmXyVDo&ab_channel=JoelHaver).
- Add sounds for each trainer.
- Create an executable for this program.
- Further investigate a way to load the frames in parallel while the application is running.
- The countdown_loop function counting is off by milliseconds for each exercise.
- Use a linter and a style guide.
